                        <p>The first mention of a dish similar to dumplings comes from ancient Greece, but the Ural region seems to be the origin place of the pelmeni. The word pelmeni is derived from pel'n'an' (пельнянь)—literally "ear bread" in the Finnic Komi and Udmurt languages. It is unclear when pelmeni entered the cuisines of the indigenous Siberian people and when they first appeared in Russian cuisine. One theory suggests pelmeni, or stuffed boiled dumplings in general, originated in Siberia, possibly a simplified adaptation of the Chinese jiaozi (in some dialects it is called Bāomiàn "包麵/包面"). Another theory suggests that pelmeni were carried by the Mongols to Siberia and the Urals, from where they gradually spread as far as Eastern Europe. Pelmeni became especially popular by Russian hunters.
                        Pelmeni are a particularly good means of quickly preserving meat during the long Siberian winter, especially eliminating the need to feed livestock during the long winter months. Thus, despite their Uralic origin, pelmeni were much influenced by the Siberian way of cooking.</p>

                    <h7 class="step" >STEP 1</h7>
                    <p>Sieve flour into a heap with a small well on the top. Gradually beat in the eggs, salt and add water little by little to form a dough. Mix and kneed it well for a few minutes, so that it is quite tight. Leave it in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.</p>
                    <h7 class="step" >STEP 2</h7>
                    <p>Mix the mince with finely chopped onion, salt and pepper. Stir in vegetable oil and mix well.</p>
                    <h7 class="step" >STEP 3</h7>
                    <p>Take the dough out of the fridge and roll it out into medium flat discs, about 2 mm thick. Cut out small round discs, about 6-7 cm in diameter, using a glass. Spoon a 1 tsp of mince into a dough disc, and pinch the edges together, so that the dumpling forms a half-moon shape. Make sure the edges are well pinched together. Place the dumplings on a plastic tray, leaving the space between them, and freeze for at least 24 hours.</p>
                    <h7 class="step" >STEP 4</h7>
                    <p>Boil a good amount of water, adding a little salt. Boil the frozen pelmeni, until they float on the surface - that's when they are ready. Drain them with a spoon and serve with melted butter, chopped dill, mustard, sour cream or vinegar.</p>
